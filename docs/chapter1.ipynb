Since there is no way to know how each model will generate and return a membrane potential time series, the `get_membrane_potential` method in this capability is left unimplemented, while the docstring describes what the model must implement in order to satisfy that capability.  In the `ToyNeuronModel` above, we see that the model implements it by simply creating a long array of resting potential values, and returning it as a `neo.core.AnalogSignal` object.  A more useful model would probably implement it by running a simulation and extracting membrane potential values from memory or disk.   \n",
    "- The second, `get_median_vm` is **already implemented**, which means there is no need for the model to do implement it again.  For its implementation to work, however, the implementation of `get_membrane_potential` must be complete.  Pre-implemented capability methods such as these allow the developer to focus on implementing only a few core interactions with the model, and then getting a lot of extra functionality for free.  In the example above, once we know that the membrane potential is being returned as a `neo.core.AnalogSignal`, we can simply take the median using numpy.  We know that the membrane potential isn't being returned as a list or a tuple or some other object on which numpy's median function won't necessarily work.  \n",

This comparison of quantities is cast into a `score` (in this case, a Z Score), bounds to some model output of interest (in this case, the model's mean membrane potential), and that `score` object is returned.  \n",

If one of the `capabilities` required by the test is not expressed by the `model`, `judge` returns a special `NAScore` score type, which can be thought of as a blank.  It's not an error -- it just means that the model, as written, is not capable of taking that test.  \n",

This is useful when batch testing many model and test combinations, so that the whole script doesn't get halted.
